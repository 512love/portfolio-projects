In this demo, I created a quick spreadsheet on the basic information management I use in my personal project in production. There is also an email that we send as a brand to some of our collaborators. The English translation would be as follows: Hi Donovan,

The Umbra team is contacting you to propose a collaboration on our next drop.

We believe that your personality and presence are a natural fit for the brand, and we are interested in exploring a collaboration with you.

For each drop, we offer:

– 1 Sobrio model (valued at $1300)
– 1 Original design model (valued at $2250)

Both pieces are delivered free of charge as part of the collaboration.

The compensation scheme consists of a 10% commission on the total of each ticket generated through your referral, with transparent sales tracking.

If you are interested, please respond with:

– City
– Size
– A brief comment on how you would integrate the garment into your environment

We look forward to your response.


In this demo, I hope to show the basic use of some programs. In addition to the real communication that I am capable of and do carry out with collaborators on personal projects.
